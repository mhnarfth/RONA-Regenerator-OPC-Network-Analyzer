# Regenerator-OPC Network Analyzer (RONA)

## Project Description

The Regenerator-OPC Network Analyzer (RONA) is a Python-based tool designed for the analysis and optimization of long-distance optical communication networks. This suite leverages output data from the Simon Network Simulator to strategically place regenerators and Optical Phase Conjugators (OPCs) along network paths. The primary goal is to minimize signal degradation and enhance network performance by optimizing the deployment of these key optical components.

RONA implements a computational pipeline that:

1.  **Parses Simon Simulator Output:**  Ingests detailed path information generated by the Simon Network Simulator, including node sequences and link distances.
2.  **Performs Path Analysis:**  Applies algorithms to determine optimal ROADM locations for regenerator and OPC placement based on a user-defined reach distance threshold.
3.  **Calculates Residual Dispersion:** Quantifies the residual uncompensated dispersion distance for each path after applying the placement strategies.
4.  **Generates CSV Output:** Produces a structured CSV file containing analysis results, facilitating further analysis and reporting.

This tool is intended to aid network designers and researchers in evaluating and optimizing optical network architectures incorporating OPCs and regenerators.

## Files in this Project

*   **`main.py`**: The main Python script that orchestrates the entire optical network path analysis workflow. It:
    *   Sets the global regenerator reach threshold.
    *   Parses the Simon Simulator output file using `input_parser.py`.
    *   Analyzes each path, placing regenerators and OPCs using functions from `path_analyzer.py`.
    *   Calculates the residual uncompensated dispersion distance using `path_analyzer.py`.
    *   Formats and writes the results to a CSV file using `output_formatter.py`.

*   **`input_parser.py`**:  A Python module responsible for parsing the text-based output file generated by the Simon Network Simulator (`simon_output_us_topology.txt`). It extracts relevant path data, including ROADM node sequences and link distances, and structures it for use by other modules.

*   **`path_analyzer.py`**: A Python module containing the core analysis logic. It implements functions for:
    *   `regenerator_placement()`:  Determines ROADM locations for placing regenerators based on a distance threshold.
    *   `opc_placement()`:  Determines ROADM locations for placing Optical Phase Conjugators (OPCs) within regenerator-defined path sections.
    *   `residual_distance_calculation()`: Calculates the residual uncompensated dispersion distance for each path.
    *   It also defines the global variable `REGENERATOR_REACH_THRESHOLD_KM`, which can be adjusted to control the regenerator placement strategy.

*   **`output_formatter.py`**:  A Python module responsible for formatting the path analysis results into a structured Comma Separated Values (CSV) format. It includes functions to:
    *   `format_path_results_csv()`:  Formats the analysis results into a list of dictionaries suitable for CSV writing.
    *   `write_csv_output()`: Writes the formatted data to a CSV file named `path_analysis_output.csv`.

*   **`requirements.txt`**:  A text file listing Python package dependencies for the project. Currently, this file is empty as the core script has no external dependencies beyond the Python standard library.

*   **`pipeline.svg`**: An SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file containing a flowchart diagram that visually represents the optical network path analysis pipeline implemented in this project. This diagram provides a high-level overview of the data flow and processing stages.

*   **`README.md`**: This file, providing a description of the project, file details, usage instructions, and important notes.

*   **`simon_output_us_topology.txt`**:  *(Example/Placeholder)* This file is intended to be replaced with the actual output file generated by the Simon Network Simulator. It should contain detailed path information in the specific format expected by the `input_parser.py` module.

*   **`venv`**:  *(Directory)* A Python virtual environment directory. This directory is created when you run `run_analysis.zsh` for the first time. It contains an isolated Python environment with any project-specific dependencies (currently none).

## Usage Instructions

To run the Optical Path Optimization Suite (OPOS) and perform the network path analysis:

1.  **Prepare Simon Simulator Output:**
    *   Run the Simon Network Simulator with your desired optical network topology file.
    *   Configure the Simon Simulator to output all-pairs shortest paths in a verbose text format (including node sequences, link distances, ROADM locations, etc.). Refer to your Simon Simulator documentation for the correct options.
    *   Save the Simon Simulator output to a text file named `simon_output_us_topology.txt`.
    *   **Crucially:** Place this `simon_output_us_topology.txt` file in the **RONA directory**

2.  **Execute the Analysis Script:**
    *   Open a terminal or command prompt.
    *   Navigate to the directory
    *   Run the analysis by executing the main.py script:

3.  **View the Results:**
    *   After the script completes, the analysis results will be written to a CSV file named `path_analysis_output.csv`. This file will be located in the same directory as the `run_analysis.zsh` script (within the `optical_network_analysis_one_shot` directory).
    *   Open `path_analysis_output.csv` using a spreadsheet program (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc) or a text editor to view the results. The CSV file contains columns for Source Node ID, Destination Node ID, Regenerator Locations, Number of Regenerators, OPC Locations, and ResidualDistance\_km for each analyzed path.

## Important Notes and Configurations

*   **Simon Simulator Output File:** Ensure that the `simon_output_us_topology.txt` file is correctly generated by the Simon Simulator and adheres to the expected format. Incorrectly formatted input will cause parsing errors and prevent the analysis from running correctly. Refer to the specification sheet for the expected Simon output format.
*   **Regenerator Reach Threshold:** The global regenerator reach threshold is defined by the variable `REGENERATOR_REACH_THRESHOLD_KM` in the `path_analyzer.py` file. The default value is set to `1000.0` kilometers. You can adjust this value by editing `path_analyzer.py` directly if you need to change the reach threshold for your analysis.

*   **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is implemented in the Python scripts. Check the terminal output for any warning or error messages during script execution.
*   **Future Extensions:** This project provides a foundation for future extensions, including:
    *   Incorporating wavelength-dependent reach thresholds.
    *   Integrating traffic matrices for more realistic traffic scenarios.
    *   Developing cost models for regenerators and OPCs.
    *   Implementing advanced OPC placement algorithms.
    *   Integrating with more detailed physical layer simulators.
